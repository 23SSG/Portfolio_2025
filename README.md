# 📊 Sonal Pradhan : Data Analytics & Machine Learning Portfolio (2025)
Welcome to Portfolio_2025, a curated collection of data analytics, visualization, and machine learning projects showcasing my transition from scientific research into a data-driven career. This repository highlights my technical foundation, applied projects, and continuous learning journey.

 🧭 **About Me**

I am a former Scientific Consultant and Research Engineer with experience supporting federally funded research for agencies such as NASA, DoD, DOE, and NIH. In these roles, I analyzed complex technical problems, synthesized data-driven insights, and translated them into clear, actionable proposals,many of which secured funding ranging from $70K to $1M.

After a planned career break for family responsibilities, I transitioned into data analytics and data science, completing the IBM Data Analyst Certification and the Associate Data Scientist track from DataCamp. I continue to upskill through hands-on projects and tools commonly used in industry.

**Core Skills**

-Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

-SQL & Databases

-Power BI & Tableau

-Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling

-Databricks (beginner), PyTorch & Snowflake (introductory)

I bring strong analytical thinking, adaptability, and curiosity, and I am comfortable learning new domains quickly and contributing in fast-paced environments.
