# Hi, I'm Sonal 👋  
Aspiring Data Analyst → Emerging Data Scientist

I’m transitioning into a data career with a strong foundation in analytics, machine learning, and cloud data tools. My journey started with the IBM Data Analyst certification and continued through the Associate Data Scientist track at DataCamp. Since then, I’ve been expanding into modern tools such as Databricks, PyTorch, and Snowflake.

I enjoy solving real-world problems, uncovering insights, and building models that make an impact. I’m currently seeking an entry-level opportunity where I can contribute, learn, and grow in a professional environment.

**Skills:**  
Python • SQL • Data Visualization • Machine Learning • Predictive Modeling • Databricks • PyTorch • Snowflake • Git/GitHub • Statistical Analysis
