# 📊 Sonal Pradhan — Data Analytics & Machine Learning Portfolio (2025)

Welcome to my **Portfolio_2025**, a curated collection of projects showcasing my journey from data analytics training to practical machine learning and cloud-based workflows. This repository captures how I built my foundations, strengthened my technical skills, and transitioned toward a data-driven career.

 🧭 About Me
I transitioned into data after completing the **IBM Data Analyst Certification**, followed by the **Associate Data Scientist Certification from DataCamp**. Since then, I’ve continued to upskill in:

- Python for Data Analysis  
- SQL & Databases  
- Power BI & Visualization  
- Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling  
- Databricks, PySpark, Snowflake  
- PyTorch for Deep Learning  

I am currently seeking **entry-level Data Analyst / Machine Learning / Data Science roles**, where I can apply my skills, gain real-world experience, and continue growing professionally.
